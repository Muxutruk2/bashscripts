# GetGit

getgit is a lazy-git-like tool to quickly navigate to a repo inside a pre-configured repo folder

## Configuration

```bash
getgit configure DIR
```

Replace DIR with the directory where the repos are stored

## Usage

```bash
getgit
```

Select the repo you want to navigate to, and it will create a new shell in that folder
